# Calculator
A Calculator program using java with java swing 
first post here ,
this programe is a Calculator with calculation priority with gui using swing in java
probleams i found out with the program so far
1- Didnt add buttons for " ( , ) " but its in the code (didnt add them becouse i found out that if you use them on any other opration but the first the program enter 
an infite loop such as 2*(5+6) )
2- i cant stop the user from enteing 2 opration in a row or more like(2**2)
3- i would like i better way to implement the plus/minus sigh in the program (at this point i just gave up)
4- if you calcuate a number and its decimal such ass 3.5 you can still add another decimal , so it become 3.5.number i would like a way to prevent that from happening
sorry for no comments in the code it self if anypart is not clear please contact me at wael255@live.com
